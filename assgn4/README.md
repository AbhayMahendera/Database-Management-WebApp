# Web Application Patch Notes

## Version 4.1.0 

### General Updates:
1. **Visual Overhaul:**
   - The entire website has undergone a visual transformation with a new theme inspired by Sneakers, providing a fresh and modern look.

### User Management:
2. **User List and Details:**
   - Regular users now have the ability to log in and view a list of other users along with their details.
   - Note: In Assignment 5, this feature will be updated to show products instead of other users.

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Two admin accounts have been deployed with the following capabilities:
     - View the website as a visitor.
     - Perform CRUD operations on the products list.
     - Perform CRUD operations on the users list.
     - View and manage orders placed (currently labeled as transactions, to be updated in Assignment 5).

4. **Account Creation:**
   - Added an option for users to create a new account easily.

5. **Forgot Password Functionality:**
   - Implemented a "Forgot Password" option for users to reset their passwords.

6. **Enhanced Email Functionality:**
   - The email link is now a clickable link that redirects users to their default email application on the device.

7. **Improved Admin Contact Form:**
   - When contacting the admin through the forgot password form, the data filled in the form is now automatically populated in the email for a more seamless communication process.

### Bug Fixes:
- Resolved an issue that took 3 days to solve, which was related to a silly mistake. This prevented the implementation of the product viewing feature for regular users in Assignment 4. The fix will be reflected in Assignment 5.

### Coming Soon (Assignment 5):
- Updates to the user interface and functionality to showcase products instead of other users for regular users.
- Further enhancements to the order management system.
