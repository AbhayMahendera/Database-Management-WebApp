Hey Abhay,

Good effort considering the time you had to work on this assignment. Overall it looks good and
you seem to have a good understanding of the concepts. The product list and api don't seem to be
there but I'm sure you would have gotten it working if you had more time. 

It was great having you in the class. I wish you all the best in your future studies and

...also thanks for the sweets! :)
